[![Download](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.tyro.oss/rabbit-amazon-bridge/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.tyro.oss/rabbit-amazon-bridge)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tyro/rabbit-amazon-bridge.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tyro/rabbit-amazon-bridge)

The rabbit-amazon-bridge is a service that helps us route rabbit messages from on-premise applications to and from services running in Amazon.

## Running the bridge

Directly using Java

```bash
java -Dspring.profiles.active=<your-profile(s)> \
     -classpath <path-to-your-properties-and-bridge-configs>:rabbit-amazon-bridge-<version>-deployable.jar org.springframework.boot.loader.JarLauncher
```

Using the pre-built docker iamge

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
    -v "<path-to-your-resources>:/app/extra-config \
    tyro/rabbit-amazon-bridge:<version> \
    --spring.profiles.active=<your-profile(s)>
```

### Mandatory properties
```properties
spring.rabbitmq.host=localhost
spring.rabbitmq.port=5672
spring.rabbitmq.username=<your rabbit mq user>
spring.rabbitmq.password=<your rabbit mq password>
spring.rabbitmq.virtual-host=/
cloud.aws.credentials.accessKey=<your aws secret key>
cloud.aws.credentials.secretKey=<your aws access key>
cloud.aws.region.static=us-east-1
bridge.config.location=classpath:bridge-config.json,file:/opt/rabbit-bridge/some-other-config.json
```

### The bridge configuration
Multiple bridge configuration files can be provided to the application using the `bridge.config.location` property.

See the example below for details of how they look.
The transformationSpecs are based on the [Jolt](https://github.com/bazaarvoice/jolt) library.
We mostly for shifting (which we use to strip out sensitive fields) and/or field renaming operations but you can do more advanced data transformation.


```json
[
  {
    "from" : {
      "rabbit": {
        "exchange": "exchange-name-1",
        "queueName": "queue-name-1",
        "routingKey": "routing-key-1"
      }
    },
    "transformationSpecs": [{
      "operation": "shift",
      "spec": {
        "fieldA": "fieldA",
        "fieldB": "fieldB"
      }
    }],
    "to" : {
      "sns": {
        "name":"rabbit-bridge-test-topic"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "from" : {
      "rabbit": {
        "exchange": "exchange-name-2",
        "queueName": "queue-name-2",
        "routingKey": "routing-key-2"
      }
    },
    "transformationSpecs": [{
      "operation": "shift",
      "spec": {
        "fieldA": "fieldA",
        "fieldB": "fieldB"
      }
    }],
    "to" : {
      "sqs": {
        "name":"rabbit-bridge-test-queue"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "from" : {
      "sqs": {
        "name":"rabbit-bridge-incoming-test-queue"
      }
    },
    "to" : {
      "rabbit": {
        "exchange": "exchange-name-3",
        "routingKey": "routing-key-3"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

#### Bridge JSON

field | description
-------|------------
from | The endpoint messages will be received from, currently SQS, or Rabbit
to | The endpoint to route messages to, current rabbit -> SQS or SNS, or SQS -> Rabbit
shouldForwardMessages | Tells the application not to configure the bridge, disabling it.

##### Rabbit From Fields

field | description
-------|------------
exchange | The name of the exchange to read from
queueName | The name of the queue that rabbit-amazon-bridge will bind to that exchange
routingKey | A single topic key that rabbit-amazon-bridge will be bound to that exchange/queue

##### Rabbit To Fields

field | description
-------|------------
exchange | The name of the exchange messages will be sent to
routingKey | A single topic that will be used when sending the message when sent to that exchange

##### SNS / SQS To Fields

field | description
-------|------------
name | The name of the queue / topic being sent to

##### SQS From fields

field | description
-------|------------
name | The name of the queue / topic being listened on


### Customised properties
We've added a few custom properties

#### Proxied comms to AWS
This may be useful for organisations who want all traffic between their on-premise artefacts and amazon to go through a proxy.

```properties
aws.proxy.host=<proxy-host>
aws.proxy.port=<proxy-port>
```

This is disabled by default

#### Default message id key for incoming messages
When messages come in from AWS on SQS or SNS they contain a 'messageId' that may be useful to some as a correlation id. 
This messageId can be added to the messages prior to publishing the to payload to rabbit. 
The format of this field is <queue-name>/messageId

```properties
default.incoming.message.id.key=globalMessageId
```

**Default**: null

#### Change your SQS endpoint url
This is used for working with elasticmq for local testing.  

```properties  
aws.sqs.endpoint.url=http://localhost:9324
aws.sqs.aws.region=localhost
```

### Additional useful Spring Properties
Rabbit amazon bridge is based on spring boot so you can use almost any property it supports using it's relaxed binding.
See [Externalized Configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html) in the spring framework docs for more details.

#### Want to use SSL to talk to rabbit?
```properties
spring.rabbitmq.ssl.enabled=true
spring.rabbitmq.ssl.algorithm=SSLv3
spring.rabbitmq.ssl.key-store=file:/certs/keystore.jks
spring.rabbitmq.ssl.key-store-type=JKS
spring.rabbitmq.ssl.key-store-password=<keystore-pass>
spring.rabbitmq.ssl.trust-store=file:/certs/truststore.jks
spring.rabbitmq.ssl.trust-store-password=<truststore-pass>
```

#### Want to set your server ports?
```properties
server.port=8080
management.server.port=8083
```

#### Make your server run SSL
```properties
server.ssl.client-auth=need
server.ssl.key-store=file:/opt/tyro/ssl/rabbit-amazon-bridge.jks
server.ssl.trust-store=file:/opt/tyro/ssl/truststore.jks
```

#### More Settings
Refer to [Common application properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/common-application-properties.html)
We will cheekily suggest applying common sense. We don't use hibernate in this project for example. 

## Development

### Regular local builds

Run 
```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

### Make targets

Target | Explanation
-------|------------
build-image | Creates a container for running builds in
test-unit | runs the unit tests against the latest build image
test-integration | runs the integration tests against the current build image
build | Runs build-image test-unit and test-integration in one go using docker

### Dependencies

* Docker
* Java 8 or higher
* Linux or Mac (Have yet to try it on Windows)

### Running a local services for manual testing
To start a local rabbit node and local elasticmq service for manual testing

#### Rabbit
Run:
```bash
./docker-services-up.sh
```

Go to: [http://localhost:15672/](http://localhost:15672/)

username: guest
password: guest

#### elastimq

Assuming you have the aws command lines tools installed:

To list queues 
```bash
aws --endpoint http://localhost:9324 sqs list-queues
```

To send a message
```bash
aws --endpoint http://localhost:9324 sqs send-message --queue-url http://localhost:9324/queue/rabbit-bridge-incoming-test-queue --message-body hello
```

To get a message
```bash
aws --endpoint http://localhost:9324 sqs receive-message --queue-url http://localhost:9324/queue/rabbit-bridge-incoming-test-queue
```
